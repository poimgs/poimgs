# Hi! I am Steven! ðŸ‘‹

My first love was Data Analytics and my love has only grown to acommodate other areas surrounding it, including Dev Ops, Cyber Security and Web Development. 

While you can find some of my projects here on GitHub, you can find others in the links below!

## Current Interest

I am currently seeking projects to understand, create, and break systems. 
In other words, I am delving deeper into Dev Ops to create systems and Cyber Security to break and protect systems. 
Through this, I hope to use what I have learnt from Data Analytics to understand these systems and use Web Development to express what I have learnt to the general audience.
